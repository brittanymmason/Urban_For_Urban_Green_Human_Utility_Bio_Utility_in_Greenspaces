iNaturalist data was obtained from https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/export between Jan 1, 2010 to Apr 23, 2023. The search engine was used to filter the data to Florida, locations with accuracy below 1000 m, and observations starting on Jan 1, 2010. The citation for the GBIF data is GBIF.org (12 May 2023) GBIF Occurrence Download https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.m23uyb. The data was filtered to just observations on or before Apr 23, 2023 to match the iNaturalist data. For both datasets, we cropped the data to Broward County to make the file size smaller, and saved these files as GBIF_data and iNaturalist_data in is folder.

The iNaturalist data was summarized to urban greenspaces of Broward county. Data was summarized for all observations that are not casual grade. The columns are poly_id (unique ID for each greenspace), park name (name of greenspace), park size in hectares, total iNaturalist observations, total iNaturalist observers, iNaturalist species count.
